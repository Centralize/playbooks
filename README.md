# Ansible Configuration Management Toolbox

## Overview

This project aims to streamline common server configuration and deployment tasks using a collection of reusable Ansible Playbooks. The toolbox is designed to provide a centralized and standardized approach to infrastructure management, enhancing consistency and reducing manual effort.

## Key Features

- Modular Design: Playbooks are organized into self-contained units, addressing specific configuration areas (e.g., web server setup, database installation, security hardening).
- Flexibility: Playbooks are parameterized, allowing customization for different environments and deployment scenarios.
- Version Control: Integration with a version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking changes, auditing, and collaboration.
- Idempotency: Playbooks are designed to be idempotent, ensuring desired states are reached without unintended side effects.

## Target Use Cases:

- Rapid Server Provisioning: Quickly set up new servers with consistent configurations.
- Configuration Updates: Apply configuration changes across multiple servers simultaneously.
- Security Patching: Roll out security updates and configuration hardening efficiently.
- Application Deployment: Automate application installation and configuration as part of deployment processes.

## Technologies:

- Ansible: Core configuration management framework.
- [Version Control System] (e.g., Git): For playbook versioning and collaboration.
- [Optional] Ansible Tower/AWX: For centralized execution and web-based user interface.

## Getting Started:

1) Clone the project repository.
2) Review and customize playbooks and associated variables as needed.
3) Execute playbooks using ansible-playbook or via an integrated tool like Ansible Tower/AWX.

## Example Playbooks:

- install_apache.yml - Installs and configures Apache web server.
- harden_ssh.yml - Implements security best practices for SSH configuration.
- deploy_wordpress.yml - Installs and sets up a WordPress instance.
